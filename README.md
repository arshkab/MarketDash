Game name and Description:
    Market Dash!
        Covid-19 has struck your town and you need to be carefull of who you come in contact with.
        the game takes place in market type place and the objective of the game is to collect as many 
        groceries as possible and without coming into contact with people roaming around the market. There
        are 4 levels and each level gets harder than the first. The game encourages social distancing by 
        making the player stay away from people while trying to go about his daily life and complete a 
        task many people do daily. You move around with arrow keys.

    we feel that this is the reason why our collision tiles are showing up instead of being hiddin in game per the parameters in our tileset found in :
    content/Maps/map.tileset.
